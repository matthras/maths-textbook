# Matt's Maths Textbook

I don't know why I'm doing this, I'm just really bored and just feel like I needed something easier to work on in my spare time (because my web dev projects require some degree of thinking/concentration which I don't necessarily have!).

The main idea is to have an entirely modular written maths resource that others can clone/download, and then insert/take out sections as needed. 

## I want to modify this for my subject/course!

That's great! At the bare minimum you'll need a LaTeX editor. The easiest thing to do is download and install the [MiKTeX distribution](https://miktex.org/) which will install everything you need, including a LaTeX editor - I personally recommend TeXWorks.
